**Updated Citation Style for the Journal of Pollination Ecology with DOI Inclusion**

This repository contains an enhanced version of the citation style for the Journal of Pollination Ecology.

I have updated the existing CSL file from the [Zotero repository][1] to support the inclusion of DOIs (Digital Object Identifiers) in citations.

I will make an update request to the Zotero repository, but until then, you can use the file `journal-of-pollination-ecology-with-doi.csl` directly with your Zotero application like this (tested for Windows & Ubuntu OS):

- download the `journal-of-pollination-ecology-with-doi.csl` from this repository;
- in your Zotero app, from the menu **Edit** select the **Preferences** option;
- in the pop-up window (named "Zotero Preferences"), select the **Cite** button;
- select the tab **Styles**;
- left click on the "+" button located on the right bottom corner of the **Style Manager** section
- navigate to where you downloaded the `journal-of-pollination-ecology-with-doi.csl` from this repository, left click on it and select **Open**
- now you should see "Journal of Pollination Ecology" listed in the **Style Manager** section. If it existed already, then this file will overwrite the existing one.
- enjoy :)
